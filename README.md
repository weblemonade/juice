# Juice

Create a new application with the following template

```bash
rails new my_app -m 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/kagedwolf/d2db48e42d3760f90942/raw/juice-app-template'
```

This will give you a generic application including

- plain twitter bootstrap layout
- font-awesome icons
- devise authentication
- role base permissions using cancan
- ui helper such as action_buttons
